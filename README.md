# Beginner Level Projects

This repository showcases some of the very first Java projects I worked on when I started my programming journey. These projects hold a special place in my learning experience, representing the foundation of my coding skills.

## Projects Included

### 1. Hangman
One of the first games I built. It's a simple word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word within a limited number of attempts.

### 2. Java Clock
This was my introduction to working with GUIs in Java. A digital clock that updates in real-time using Java's `Swing` package.

### 3. Calculator App
A basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations. Creating this helped me understand event handling and user interface design.

### 4. Snake Game
This was my first step into game development. It's a simple version of the classic snake game, and building it taught me a lot about game loops and animations.

### 5. Tic Tac Toe
A two-player game of Tic Tac Toe. This project helped me grasp concepts like arrays and implementing game logic.

## Reflection

Each of these projects marks a milestone in my journey of learning Java. They might be simple, but they taught me the fundamentals and gave me the confidence to take on more complex challenges.

Feel free to explore these projects. They remind me of where I started and how far I've come.
